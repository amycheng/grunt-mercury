grunt-mercury
=============

This is an *opinionated* (all of my own opinion) web project boilerplate and uses the following:

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for running common tasks
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) for writing CSS
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) for good default css
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) as a baseline HTML

This boilerplate is bare bones because I wanted the flexibility to add frameworks and tools as I need them. Also I didn't want a boilerplate that has a ton of dependencies.

## To Use

1. download or run `git clone`
2. run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. run `grunt` to start up the server
